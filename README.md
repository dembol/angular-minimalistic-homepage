# angular-minimalistic-homepage

This is minimalistic homepage template built on top of AngularJS. It is my side project and I did it for my personal purposes but maybe it'll be useful for others. So feel free to use it, hack it and contribute by forking, opening issues, making pull requests.

# Demo

You can find online demo site [here](http://dembol.org) - this is my personal homepage.
